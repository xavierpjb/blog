        This is a summary of the things I did during my interview and
        study process throughout my preperation. The gist of this
        is to start prepping months ahead of time to allow yourself to learn
        each topic for algo/ds well enough to solve unseen leetcode easys in
        under 15 mins, mediums in 20-30 mins and hards in under 45 mins.

      <h3 class="font-medium leading-tight text-3xl mt-0 mb-2 text-blue-600">Background</h3>
      <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mt-0 mb-4 text-gray-800">
        I Studied at UMass Dartmouth (NOT the ivy league school) and graduated
        at 20 in 2019. From 2019 to 2020 I worked at
        <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/blog/tags/dell-emc/">Dell EMC</a>,
        where I spent a year doing front end development.

        The following year, me and a good friend of mine built a startup, Mvral
        (pronouced mural) which we stopped after a year since we couldn't figure
        out how to generate revenue of the app we made.

        After telling myself I would return to grad school, I figured I might as
        well have spend my extra time studying for coding interviews, since if
        you're trying to work at most of these impactful and well paying places,
        you'll need that. Ended up not going because I got offers.
      </p>

      <h3 class="font-medium leading-tight text-3xl mt-0 mb-2 text-blue-600">Duration of Studies</h3>
      <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mt-0 mb-4 text-gray-800">
        I started intensely studying for algo/ds mid July 2021 and practiced
        leetcoding and mock interviews until the (virtual) onsite interviews,
        which occured mid April 2022 <b>(9 MONTHS OF PREPARATION)</b>.

        This time varies widely from person to person. I've read some people
        who preped for 2 weeks, many mention 3 months to be sufficient, while
        other have spent years trying to crack it, so don't feel bad if it seems
        to be taking long to solve these sorts of problems.

        Moreover, this prepartion was solely for algo/ds. I didn't do much
        system design since I wouldn't get interviewed on it, but I would assume
        that an extra 2 to 6 months of prep would be added if I had to study that
        as well.

      <h3 class="font-medium leading-tight text-3xl mt-0 mb-2 text-blue-600">Offers</h3>
      <p class="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mt-0 mb-4 text-gray-800">
        I was able to get an Amazon internship and return offer (SDE1 ~200k),
        and a Google offer (L3 ~230k), both in nyc.
