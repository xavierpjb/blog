          This is a summary of the things I did during my interview and
          study process throughout my preperation. The gist of this
          is to start prepping months ahead of time to allow yourself to learn
          each topic for algo/ds well enough to solve unseen leetcode easys in
          under 15 mins, mediums in 20-30 mins and hards in under 45 mins.

        <h2 className="font-medium leading-tight text-4xl mt-0 mb-2 text-blue-600">Introduction</h2>
        <h3 className="font-medium leading-tight text-3xl mt-0 mb-2 text-blue-400">Background</h3>
        <p className="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mt-0 mb-4 text-gray-800">
          I Studied at UMass Dartmouth (NOT the ivy league school) and graduated
          at 20 in 2019. From 2019 to 2020 I worked at
          <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/blog/tags/dell-emc/">Dell EMC</a>,
          where I spent a year doing front end development.

          The following year, me and a good friend of mine built a startup, Mvral
          (pronouced mural) which we stopped after a year since we couldn't figure
          out how to generate revenue of the app we made.

          After telling myself I would return to grad school, I figured I might as
          well have spend my extra time studying for coding interviews, since if
          you're trying to work at most of these impactful and well paying places,
          you'll need that. Ended up not going because I got offers.
        </p>

        <h3 className="font-medium leading-tight text-3xl mt-0 mb-2 text-blue-400">Duration of Studies</h3>
        <p className="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mt-0 mb-4 text-gray-800">
          I started intensely studying for algo/ds mid July 2021 and practiced
          leetcoding and mock interviews until the (virtual) onsite interviews,
          which occured mid April 2022 <b>(9 MONTHS OF PREPARATION)</b>.

          This time varies widely from person to person. I've read some people
          who preped for 2 weeks, many mention 3 months to be sufficient, while
          other have spent years trying to crack it, so don't feel bad if it seems
          to be taking long to solve these sorts of problems.

          Moreover, this prepartion was solely for algo/ds. I didn't do much
          system design since I wouldn't get interviewed on it, but I would assume
          that an extra 2 to 6 months of prep would be added if I had to study that
          as well.

        <h3 className="font-medium leading-tight text-3xl mt-0 mb-2 text-blue-400">Offers</h3>
        <p className="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mt-0 mb-4 text-gray-800">
          I was able to get an Amazon internship and return offer (SDE1 ~200k),
          and a Google offer (L3 ~230k), both in nyc.

        <h3 className="font-medium leading-tight text-3xl mt-0 mb-2 text-blue-400"> Learning algorithms and data structures</h3>
        <p className="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mt-0 mb-4 text-gray-800">
          The most essential part of your interview process is to learn about
          algorithms and data structures. My studies consisted of:

        <p className="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mt-0 mb-4 text-gray-800">
          This playlist of lectures is a good introduction to a broad set of
          algorithms and data structures. They go over time complexities and proofs
          behind different algorithms. I didn't focus to much on the proofs, but
          understanding how/why algorithms works is essential as this will help
          you in reproducing them during an interview.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mt-0 mb-4 text-gray-800">
          I recommend going through these lectures and taking notes on the different
          topics. It will help when refreshing your memory on what the lectures
          talked about.

          This book was used along side the lectures when I wanted to get written
          information of the algorithms discussed, but also contained good
          exercises to try for what was discussed.

          Though you may not need to go through this second set of lectures, I
          found that having this information in a second form made it easier
          to learn since I breezed through the parts I had a solid understanding
          of from the first lecture, and took my time on what I lacked.
